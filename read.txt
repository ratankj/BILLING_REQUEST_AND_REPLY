The issue you're encountering where no Data elements are found in the XML files can be due to several reasons:

Incorrect XPath Expression: 
The XPath expression used to find Data elements may not be correct for the XML structure. It's essential to verify that .//ns1:Data matches the actual structure of your XML files.

Namespace Issue: Ensure that the namespace defined (ns1) matches exactly with the namespace used in the XML files. Any discrepancy here will result in the XPath query not finding any elements.

XML Structure: Verify that the XML files indeed contain Data elements under the root element (MT_BillingEdition_Res) and that these elements are correctly nested within the namespace.

To debug and resolve this issue, follow these steps:

Step-by-Step Debugging:
Print Root Tag: Verify that the root tag identified (MT_BillingEdition_Res) matches the expected structure. This confirms that the XML is parsed correctly.

Check Namespace: Ensure that the namespace (ns1) matches exactly with the namespace used in the XML files. Even a minor difference (e.g., case sensitivity) will cause the XPath query to fail.

Inspect XML Structure: Open one of the XML files (Reply_GL8976867_20240509-005207-355.xml) in a text editor or XML viewer to confirm the presence and structure of Data elements under MT_BillingEdition_Res.

Adjust XPath: If the structure is correct but the XPath expression still doesn't find Data elements, try different XPath expressions. For example:

Use .//ns1:MT_BillingEdition_Res/ns1:Data to directly specify the path from root.
Use .//{http://mdm.com/xi/MDM_BPDCL/ID0005_BillingEdition}Data without namespace prefix to see if it works without namespace.
Error Handling: Implement error handling around the parsing and finding of elements (try-except blocks) to capture and print any exceptions that might occur during XML parsing or element finding.

Here's an example adjustment to your code to explicitly specify the path from root and handle exceptions:




Further Steps:
Verify Namespace: Double-check the namespace in the XML files (http://mdm.com/xi/MDM_BPDCL/ID0005_BillingEdition) and ensure it matches the one used (ns1) in the code.

Test with a Sample XML: If the issue persists, isolate one XML file that is failing (Reply_GL8976867_20240509-005207-355.xml in this case), open it, and manually verify the structure and namespaces.

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling around the XML parsing and element extraction to catch any unexpected issues.

By carefully debugging and verifying each step, you should be able to identify why the Data elements are not being found and rectify the issue accordingly.
